## TL Professional Growth Evaluation

All TLs (paid and for credit) in the Allegheny's CIS department will be evaluated throughout the semester by faculty based on the following rubric for each area of the TL responsibilities. 

- __Effective__: Meets excellence (as described above).
- __Developing__: Needs to make improvements and has a plan for making suggested improvements.
- __Ineffective__: Poor performance and no effort made to make suggested improvements.

The growth ratings are designed to give technical leaders an assessment of where they stand in all performance areas with detailed guidance on what is expected to improve. All TLs will receive feedback at least twice during each semester. Growth rating of `F` means failure of the CMPSC 593 for credit-taking employees and the dismissal from the position for paid employees. Growth ratings below `B` significantly reduces the chances of rehire.

|Growth rating |Performance|
|--------------|------------|
|A-level       | Effective in 4-5 areas |
|B-level       | Effective in 2-3 areas, developing in the other areas |
|C-level       | Effective in 1-2 areas, developing in the other areas |
|D-level       | Developing in 4-5 areas, ineffective in at most 1 area |  
|F-level       | Ineffective in 2 or more areas |
