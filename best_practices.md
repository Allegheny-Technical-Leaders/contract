## Best Practices for Technical Leaders in Computer Science

* Keep up with the course lecture material, follow the course schedule to know what material is covered.
* Review the assignment in advance and develop own solution if needed.
* Help students solve the assignments in their own way, without providing the solution.
* Help students arrive at the solution by drawing out steps on paper (or as a diagram).
* Physical presence during the practicals and the labs:
  * walk through the classroom from time to time,
  * check on students progress,
  * ask students if they have any questions.
* Take turns answering questions (if not busy), call on the next Technical Leader.
* Keep the laboratory sessions professional (minimize discussions not related to Computer Science), but keep them fun.
* Organize group study sessions for struggling students, if needed.
* Be patient when helping students.
* Encourage and motivate students, both struggling and excelling, by showing your relentless enthusiasm for computer science.
* Discourage performance comparison by students.
* Try to come up with examples that are relatable to the student (i.e. if you know they are a senior taking it for distribution and know their major is something else, try tying it into their actual major to spark interest).
* For the introductory courses, remember that most of the students will have had no exposure to computer science before this class. Check to make sure they understand the problem and can walk you through it in a pseudo-code or natural language process first then take them step by step clearly explaining what one line or multiple lines do.
